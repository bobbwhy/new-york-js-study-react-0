# React Project 0
_by the New York Javascript Study Group_

This is a practice project for members of the New York Javascript Study Group.

The goals of this project: 

**1: Help members of the group practice developing a site from start to 
deployment to maintenance.**  
Although this will be focused on .js, we will also work with other aspects of 
development and team work including:
 
    1: agile methods of working with teams.
    2: .git repo methods.
    3: working with databases.
    
**2: Provide a web site for the members of the group and the public.**

### Rules: 
**1. Treat all members with respect and ensure this is a positive learning project.** 
If someone makes mistakes, the goal is to help them improve and provide a safe space 
for making mistakes and learning.

**2: Anyone who makes an accepted contribution to the code must demonstrate their work at a group meeting.** 
At this meeting, we will ensure that the code is understood by all project 
members.  Also, the members will help to review the code and offer suggestions.

**3: During said demo, the contributor must also give a walk through of their code to the group.**
